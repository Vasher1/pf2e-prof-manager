# PF2e Skill Proficiency Manager

An easy way to handle skill increases
Click the edit button next to core skills in your character sheet to access it.

NOTE: Works best with new characters, as there's no 100% way to tell where existing proficiency levels came from.

It's possible to get it working with existing characters, but you would have to set them back to level 1, untrained in skills, and set their inteligence back to the value it was at level 1
You could then progress through the levels using the manager to update proficiencies
